## üîê Authentication

The server uses the Device Authorization Flow for authentication, which provides a secure way to authenticate without directly handling credentials. Here's how it works:

1. When you first try to access any tool that requires authentication, the server will initiate the Device Authorization Flow.
2. You'll receive:
    - A verification URL (e.g., https://auth.audiense.com/activate).
    - A user code to enter on that page.
3. Visit the verification URL and enter the provided code.
4. Complete the authentication process in your browser.
5. The server will automatically handle the token management after successful authentication.
6. You can continue using the MCP.

### Troubleshooting Authentication
If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Ensure you've completed the authentication process in your browser
2. Try the operation again after a few seconds
3. If issues persist, restart the authentication flow by trying the operation again
